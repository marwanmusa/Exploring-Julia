# How to println
println("Hello world")

# How to assign variables
my_var = 50
typeof(my_var)

my_pi = 3.14159
typeof(my_pi)

ðŸš€ = "My Rocket!"
typeof(ðŸš€)

#=
After assigning a value to a variable, we can reassign a value
of a differebt type to that variable without any issue.
=#

ðŸš€ = 3
typeof(ðŸš€)

#=
Note: Julia allows us to write super generic code, and ðŸš€ is an example of this.<br>
This allows us to write code like
=#

ðŸš² = 0
ðŸš• = -1

ðŸš• + ðŸš€ == ðŸš² # will result -> true


# How to comment
# You can leave comments on a single line using the pound/hash key

#=

For multi-line comments,
use the '#= =#' sequence.

# Syntax for basic math
sum = 3 + 7
difference = 10 - 3
product = 20 * 5
quotient = 100 / 10
power = 10 ^ 2
modulus = 101 % 2
